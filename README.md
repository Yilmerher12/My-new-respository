# Hi, I'm [Your Name] ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student of the ADSO program at SENA, currently learning software development.  
My goal is to become a fullstack web developer and build projects that solve real problems.

## Technologies I'm Learning
- HTML & CSS  
- JavaScript  
- Git & GitHub 
- Databases
- Containers (soon) 
- React (soon)  
- Node.js & Databases (coming soon)

## My Learning Journey
I enjoy learning step by step, understanding each concept before moving on.  
This repository is part of my journey to practice Git, GitHub, and teamwork skills. I'd probably change during this path, but I'll mainly focus on learn, learn and just learn.

## Goals
- Improve my programming skills.
- Build and share personal projects.
- Collaborate with other developers or show all my skills.
